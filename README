Approach:


Caching algorithm - simple Least Frequently Used
--Since we are given the probabilities from the outset, we do not need to take measurements, as
a normal web caching system would.

If (Size_of_webpage < free_space_in_cache)
    Store webpage in cache
Else
    Find the lowest cumulative probability that can be uncached in order to cache new page
    If (cumulative_probability < probability_of_new_webpage)
        Remove pages from cache
        Cache new page
