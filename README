Approach:


Caching algorithm - simple Least Frequently Used
--Since we are given the probabilities from the outset, we do not need to take measurements, as
a normal web caching system would.
--We can try using a "cache everywhere" strategy. When one HTTP server's cache is updated, we
can get every other server's cache to update as well, since we always move towards a "better"
cache in this project with probabilities fixed.
----If probabilities were not fixed, we would need to bootstrap for some period of time while
taking measurements and figuring out which pages actually are most popular.

If (Size_of_webpage < free_space_in_cache)
    Store webpage in cache
Else
    Find the lowest cumulative probability that can be uncached in order to cache new page
    If (cumulative_probability < probability_of_new_webpage)
        Remove pages from cache
        Cache new page
